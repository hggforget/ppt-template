\caption{Using the same hyperparameters across all domains, DreamerV3 outperforms specialized model-free and model-based algorithms in a wide range of benchmarks and data-efficiency regimes. Applied out of the box, DreamerV3 also learns to obtain diamonds in the popular video game Minecraft from scratch given sparse rewards, a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence for which previous approaches required human data or domain-specific heuristics.}
