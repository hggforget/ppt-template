\caption{Multi-step video predictions in DMLab (top) and Control Suite (bottom). From 5 frames of context input, the model predicts 45 steps into the future given the action sequence and without access to intermediate images. The world model learns an understanding of the underlying 3D structure of the two environments. Refer to \cref{sec:openl} for additional video predictions.}
