\caption{DMLab scores with a budget of 50M frames. Separate agents were trained for each task, corresponding to the IMPALA Experts method in \citet{espeholt2018impala}. Data efficiency is not the goal of IMPALA and it might be possible to tune it for improved data efficiency. Longer training curves and asymptotic performance of IMPALA are included in \cref{sec:dmlab_eff}.}
