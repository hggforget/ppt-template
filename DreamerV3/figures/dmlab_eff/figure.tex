\caption{IMPALA training curves on DMLab for 10 billion frames compared to DreamerV3 score. DreamerV3 uses 100$\times$ fewer frames, which is almost at the left edge of the plot, as shown by the markers. Note that data efficiency was not the goal of IMPALA. Instead, it serves as a valuable baseline for the performance achievable by top RL algorithms without data constraints.}
