\caption{Training process of DreamerV3. The world model encodes sensory inputs into a discrete representation $z_t$ that is predicted by a sequence model with recurrent state $h_t$ given actions $a_t$. The inputs are reconstructed as learning signal to shape the representations. The actor and critic learn from trajectories of abstract representations predicted by the world model.}
